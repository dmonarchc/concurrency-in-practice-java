# Java Concurrency in Practice ‚Äì Study and Examples

This repository contains a collection of examples, exercises, and notes based on the book **"Java Concurrency in Practice"** by Brian Goetz and others. The main goal is to learn and master the fundamentals of concurrent programming in Java through hands-on practice.

## üìò About the Book

*"Java Concurrency in Practice"* is one of the most comprehensive and practical texts on multithreaded programming in Java. It covers topics from the basics like visibility and atomicity to high-level tools such as `ExecutorService`, `Future`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, and more.
